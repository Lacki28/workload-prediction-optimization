## General description
This repo includes the code for the master thesis: Towards Accurate Times Series  Predictions for Cloud Workloads

The predictions using only one time series can be found in the directory: test_with_one_timeseries

The predictions for multiple jobs are in the directory generalization_tests

The data was prepared using the files in the data_preparation_plots and the prepared jobs are in sortedGroupedJobFiles
The clustered data can be found in clustered_jobs, where on can see the jobs belonging to cluster zero in folder 0 and 
jobs belonging to cluster -1 are in the folder 1.
